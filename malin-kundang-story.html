                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Malin Kundang</p><p></p><p>A long time ago, on the north coast of Sumatera lived a widow and her only son named Malin Kundang. They were living in poverty. Malin Kundang grew up as a skillful young boy. He always wanted to be a successful person to help her mother.</p><p></p><p>One day, a large ship of a rich merchant docked nearby. Malin Kundang met one of the ship’s crew and was offered to join with him. He knew that it was a good chance to make his dream came true. So he decided to accept the offer and went home to tell his mother. “Mom, what if I sail overseas?” asked Malin Kundang to his beloved mother. “Oh dear, I can’t let you do that. I lost your father; he was sailing and never came back. I don’t want to lose you too,” her mother replied.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang kept trying to convince his mother that he would be all right, “Mom, if I stay here, I’ll always be a poor man. I want to be a successful person to help us to get a better life. I promise you that I’ll be back for you.” His mother wiped her own tears, “If you really want to go, I can’t stop you my son. I could only pray to God for you to gain your success in life,” said his mother wisely. In the next morning, Malin Kundang was ready to go.</p><p></p><p>It had been a year since Malin Kundang left his mother. Her mother never heard any news from Malin Kundang. However, she kept waiting and praying for his son to come home safely. After several years of waiting, she was surprised by arrival of a wealthy merchant in the ship dock. When the large ship pulled over, Malin’s mother saw a wealthy man who was stepping down the ladder along with a beautiful woman. The man turned out to be her only son, Malin Kundang.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, she came running to hug her son. “Oh my dear son, I miss you so much.” However, Malin Kundang did not give any response. He was too ashamed to admit that the old woman was his own mother in front of his beautiful wife. “Who are you? You’re not my mother. My mother has passed away when I was kid,” said Malin Kundang. Malin’s mother took a step back, “Malin, what do you mean? I’m your mother!” she said sadly.</p><p></p><p>Malin Kundang then ordered his bodyguard to take the old woman away from him, “Take this old and filthy woman out of here!” Malin’s mother cried as he was dragged by the bodyguard, “Malin, my son. How could you do this to me? Why do you treat your own mother like this?” she sobbed.</p><p></p><p>As her heart was broken and felt very disappointed to her son, she cried and shouted, “Oh God, if he is my real son, I curse him into stone!” After that, Malin Kundang continued his journey and once again left his mother. In the middle of a calm sea, suddenly the wind was blowing so hard and a storm came.

                        <p>Once upon a time, in a seaside village in Padang, West Sumatra lived a widow called Mande Rubayah with her only son, Malin Kundang. Mande Rubayah loved her son so much, which turned Malin Kundang a spoiled child. One day, Malin Kundang suffered a severe sickness, that his mother gave every cent of her life savings to cure his illness. Days, months, and years passed by, Malin Kundang turned adult and his mother an old woman. Malin Kundang asked his mother to let him hitch a docked ship nearby and wander to the big cities to get better fortunes for the family.</p><p></p><p>Mande denied his request and asked Malin to stay and take care of his mother instead.</p><p></p><p>“Mother, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me. Not every year a ship this large docks here. I want to take this opportunity to change our fate, please let me go,” Malin pleaded his mother.</p><p></p><p>With a sad heart, Mande finally accepted his plea.</p><p></p><p>“Please be back soon, my child. I will be waiting for you here,” Mande cried.</p><p></p><p>Days by days passed slowly while waiting for Malin. She prayed every single day for Malin to go home safely. To every ship’s crews and captains, she asked for Malin’s whereabouts and did not get a single answer nor message for her.</p><p></p><p>Many years full of waiting passed and Mande Rubayah grew older and weaker, while she heard the news from a ship captain nearby that Malin married to a noble and rich woman from a big city. “Mande, do you know that your son is now married to a beautiful woman, a daughter of a very rich noble,” said the captain.</p><p></p><p>“Malin, my son. Please go home soon, I am already old and weak. Please be home soon,” his mother prayed every single day to meet her long-awaited son.</p><p></p><p>Months later, another large ship docked near the village. It was the most luxurious and beautiful ship Mande had ever seen. A pair of rich couples walked off the ship with lustrous and gold-embroidered attires. Mande immediately recognized the couple, rushed through the crowds, and hugged the rich man in the lustrous attire.</p><p></p><p>“Malin, my son. You’re back!” Mande broke her tears happily and relieved. “Why didn’t you send me a message? I miss you, my child”.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Malin jolted and pushed Mande away from him. His wife also looked down on Mande without any respect. Malin’s wife spat and shouted at Malin and Mande, “Is this rumpled old woman your mother? Why would you lie to me, Malin? You said that your mother is also a noblewoman like me?”</p><p></p><p>Hearing that, Malin became furious and pushed his mother to fall to the sand, “You mad woman! I am not your son!” he snapped at his mother.</p><p></p><p>Mande Rubayah sunk in disbelief and hugged Malin’s feet. “Malin, oh Malin! I’ve been waiting for you this long. Why would you do this to me, your mother?”</p><p></p><p>Full of anger, Malin kicked his mother away, “You are not my mother. You are ugly, poor, and dirty,” yelled Malin.</p><p></p><p>Mande cried brokenheartedly. She felt weak, sad, and desperate while Malin and his wife turned their backs and walked away to their ship.</p><p></p><p>The ship sailed away and the crowds left Mande alone by the shore. Mande cried and prayed, “Oh, God. If he was not my son, I will forgive his actions to me. But if he is Malin Kundang, I ask you for your righteousness!”</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the sky turned dark and the wind blew violently. The rain fell upon the earth with a destructive storm.</p><p></p><p>The storm shook Malin’s ship, furious thunders hit the ship unforgivingly and blazed it into pieces.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, shipwrecks shored near the village with a kneeling man-shaped stone between the debris. This stone was believed as the cursed form of Malin Kundang, kneeling for forgiveness from his mother until today.</p><br />
