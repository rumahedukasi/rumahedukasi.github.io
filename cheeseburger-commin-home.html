                                            Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming   
Intro :  “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Hence, when you tell people that they are "too skinny" or to "eat more", even if it's just for fun, that means you are praising them and that they shouldn't feel offended by your words. But is that really a praise ?   
Supporting arguments :   In day-to-day life, thin women state that they're often on the receiving end of comments such as: “just eat the sandwich”; “you’re all skin and bones”; and “do you even eat?”. Someone in a thin body—particularly a woman—may be teased, bullied, or discriminated against for not possessing a certain body type historically associated with femininity and the male gaze. Thin women are disgustingly told that “only dogs want bones,” and that their lack of curves is unattractive. Thin women may also be food policed: chided for their rightful choice to order a salad, or screamed at, even by strangers, to “eat a cheeseburger.” They are assumed to have eating disorders, as if anorexia and bulimia are body types. This treatment is inarguably unacceptable.  
Contrary Arguments :   On the other hand, Sonya Renee Taylor, author of The Body Is Not an Apology explained that "“While someone may tease a thin person, thin people are not disproportionately misdiagnosed as a result of medical fatphobia. Collectively, people are not paid less, hired less, or systemically harmed and discriminated against for being thin.”  For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease.   As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.  
Conclusion :  Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin.   This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.  Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.

                                            My family ate dinner at Merrymead Diner every Friday night while I was a child. We huddled close in a large, red booth as we scanned the familiar menu. The aroma of gravy over creamy mashed potatoes lingered in the air. I snuggled close to my mom’s arm as she ordered our drinks. The waitress brought our thick milkshakes out on a tray and placed them in front of us on a paper doily. The jukebox in the back played songs that we all knew the words to, and we sang along until our food arrived, hot and enticing on the table. Outside I shivered in the cold air, but in the diner, I was cozy, munching on crispy French fries and enjoying a hot, juicy cheeseburger.</a>

                                            Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming   
Intro :  “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Hence, when you tell people that they are "too skinny" or to "eat more", even if it's just for fun, that means you are praising them and that they shouldn't feel offended by your words. But is that really a praise ?   
Supporting arguments :   In day-to-day life, thin women state that they're often on the receiving end of comments such as: “just eat the sandwich”; “you’re all skin and bones”; and “do you even eat?”. Someone in a thin body—particularly a woman—may be teased, bullied, or discriminated against for not possessing a certain body type historically associated with femininity and the male gaze. Thin women are disgustingly told that “only dogs want bones,” and that their lack of curves is unattractive. Thin women may also be food policed: chided for their rightful choice to order a salad, or screamed at, even by strangers, to “eat a cheeseburger.” They are assumed to have eating disorders, as if anorexia and bulimia are body types. This treatment is inarguably unacceptable.  
Contrary Arguments :   On the other hand, Sonya Renee Taylor, author of The Body Is Not an Apology explained that "“While someone may tease a thin person, thin people are not disproportionately misdiagnosed as a result of medical fatphobia. Collectively, people are not paid less, hired less, or systemically harmed and discriminated against for being thin.”  For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease.   As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.  
Conclusion :  Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin.   This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.  Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.

                            4. Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming   
Intro :  “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Hence, when you tell people that they are "too skinny" or to "eat more", even if it's just for fun, that means you are praising them and that they shouldn't feel offended by your words. But is that really a praise ?   
Supporting arguments :   In day-to-day life, thin women state that they're often on the receiving end of comments such as: “just eat the sandwich”; “you’re all skin and bones”; and “do you even eat?”. Someone in a thin body—particularly a woman—may be teased, bullied, or discriminated against for not possessing a certain body type historically associated with femininity and the male gaze. Thin women are disgustingly told that “only dogs want bones,” and that their lack of curves is unattractive. Thin women may also be food policed: chided for their rightful choice to order a salad, or screamed at, even by strangers, to “eat a cheeseburger.” They are assumed to have eating disorders, as if anorexia and bulimia are body types. This treatment is inarguably unacceptable.  
Contrary Arguments :   On the other hand, Sonya Renee Taylor, author of The Body Is Not an Apology explained that "“While someone may tease a thin person, thin people are not disproportionately misdiagnosed as a result of medical fatphobia. Collectively, people are not paid less, hired less, or systemically harmed and discriminated against for being thin.”  For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease.   As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.  
Conclusion :  Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin.   This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.  Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.

For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease. 
As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.
Conclusion : 
Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin. 
This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.
Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.

                            17. Body Shaming : Skinny Shaming   
Intro :  “Body shaming,” the act of humiliating someone for their size, can happen to anyone. In our society, to be called "thin" is generally a compliment. To be “fat,” by contrast, means facing a stigma on a daily basis, particularly about one’s health. Hence, when you tell people that they are "too skinny" or to "eat more", even if it's just for fun, that means you are praising them and that they shouldn't feel offended by your words. But is that really a praise ?  
 Supporting arguments :   In day-to-day life, thin women state that they're often on the receiving end of comments such as: “just eat the sandwich”; “you’re all skin and bones”; and “do you even eat?”. Someone in a thin body—particularly a woman—may be teased, bullied, or discriminated against for not possessing a certain body type historically associated with femininity and the male gaze. Thin women are disgustingly told that “only dogs want bones,” and that their lack of curves is unattractive. Thin women may also be food policed: chided for their rightful choice to order a salad, or screamed at, even by strangers, to “eat a cheeseburger.” They are assumed to have eating disorders, as if anorexia and bulimia are body types. This treatment is inarguably unacceptable.  
Contrary Arguments :   On the other hand, Sonya Renee Taylor, author of The Body Is Not an Apology explained that "“While someone may tease a thin person, thin people are not disproportionately misdiagnosed as a result of medical fatphobia. Collectively, people are not paid less, hired less, or systemically harmed and discriminated against for being thin.”  For example, designers usually use thin women as models because  the clothes hang off them nicely because they have fewer curves and rolls. Being thin is obviously better than being fat because it has lower risk of developing diabetes, stroke, cancer, or heart disease.   As such, while body shaming absolutely is something that people in thin bodies deal with (and shouldn’t have to), and while the effects of that can be devastating, thin people do not experience weight-based oppression in the same way as fat people.  
Conclusion :  Society seems to think commenting on thin bodies is some sort of compliment. That means telling thin person to "go eat something" is a very acceptable joke while it's not. Commenting on someone's body is never okay because it's harmful to people who are still becoming comfortable in their own skin.   This also means that phrases like, “Real women have curves,” or “She needs to eat a cheeseburger,” need to go in the trash can. The definition of a “real woman” has nothing to do with her size or physical appearance.  Real women know their worth, no matter what size they are. They eat cheeseburgers, they work out, they are naturally slim, they are voluptuous, they are plus-size, and they love themselves. They have integrity, they are strong, they are kind, but most of all, they absolutely never make snide comments about the body type of another woman.
