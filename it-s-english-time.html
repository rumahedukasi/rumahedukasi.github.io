I want it all
And I am wishing they “d stop tryna turn me off.
I want it on
And I am walking on a wire
Trying to go higher
Feel s like I am surrounded 
By clown and liars
Even when I give it all away
I want it all
We came here to run it, run it , run it
We came here to run it , run it
Just like fire, burning up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day 
Watch this madness , colorful charade 
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I will be flying free
I am disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling , What you gonna say ?
Just like fire

                            15. When i was in primary school i have1 12 subjects one is english subject.at that time i didn't like english because the pronounciation of english is very difficult and very difficult to understand .but one day my teacher teach2 about conversation and my teacher gave us one dialogue to do in pairs .my friend and i tried to talk in english with the dialogue that my teacher give for us3 and i start to tried4 speak and understand word by word and i felt happy when i can speak well and at that time i chose english being my favorite subject until now. (2) cross cultural communication – module &amp; assignment one john wem haan if we talk about the word "teacher" everybody knows that teacher a person who5 teaches in a school. nowadays teacher is not just teach6 in school but privite place and so on. …. (3) teacher is a person who teach7 or gives their knowledge to another people or in a context to student in a school. teacher has an important role for building a future such as build a student character. but later in many country, people that want to be a teacher is very little. it is a massive problem for the environment because when there is no one that build8 the character of students then there is a stake of future. (4) for this accasian as it seens9 on chart 1, which is talk10 about the number of library books readed by boys and girls, their presented by the chart is looks increased11 and down from 2009-2012, and for their explanation is on below. it will be started by the reader of man, man are loves to read. it can be pict on the chart rather than woman, they were increased in specifictly from time to time. in 2009-2010 they were increased12 on 20%-40%, and it keep rising up until 100% in 2011 and they can increased until 140 % in 2012. so it‟s why i say man are loves13 to read in starmouth school library. while womans are not like that, they were different. they have been increased specificlybut being down on 2012. they were in 40% in 2009- 80 % in 2010. they have keep increased to 100% and be the same to man in 2011,</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Ketika saya di sekolah dasar saya memiliki 1 12 mata pelajaran salah satunya adalah mata pelajaran bahasa Inggris. pada waktu itu saya tidak suka bahasa Inggris karena pengucapan bahasa Inggris sangat sulit dan sangat sulit untuk dipahami. tetapi suatu hari guru saya mengajar 2 tentang percakapan dan guru saya memberi kami satu dialog untuk dilakukan berpasangan .teman saya dan saya mencoba berbicara dalam bahasa Inggris dengan dialog yang diberikan guru saya untuk kami3 dan saya mulai mencoba4 berbicara dan memahami kata demi kata dan saya merasa senang ketika saya dapat berbicara dengan baik dan pada saat itu Saya memilih bahasa Inggris sebagai mata pelajaran favorit saya sampai sekarang. (2) komunikasi lintas budaya – modul &amp; tugas one john wem haan jika kita berbicara tentang kata "guru" semua orang tahu bahwa guru adalah seseorang yang mengajar di sebuah sekolah. Saat ini guru tidak hanya mengajar di sekolah tetapi di tempat pribadi dan sebagainya. …. (3) guru adalah orang yang mengajar7 atau memberikan ilmunya kepada orang lain atau dalam konteks kepada siswa di suatu sekolah. Guru memiliki peran penting untuk membangun masa depan seperti membangun karakter siswa. tapi kemudian di banyak negara, orang yang ingin menjadi guru sangat sedikit. Ini adalah masalah besar bagi lingkungan karena ketika tidak ada yang membangun karakter siswa maka ada taruhan masa depan. (4) untuk akasia ini seperti yang terlihat9 pada bagan 1 yaitu pembicaraan10 tentang jumlah buku perpustakaan yang dibaca oleh anak laki-laki dan perempuan, penyajiannya pada bagan terlihat meningkat11 dan turun dari tahun 2009-2012, dan untuk penjelasannya ada di bawah ini . itu akan dimulai oleh pembaca pria, pria suka membaca. dapat digambarkan pada grafik daripada wanita, mereka meningkat secara khusus dari waktu ke waktu. pada tahun 2009-2010 meningkat12 pada 20%-40%, dan terus meningkat hingga 100% pada tahun 2011 dan dapat meningkat hingga 140% pada tahun 2012. jadi itulah mengapa saya katakan pria suka membaca13 di perpustakaan sekolah starmouth . sedangkan wanita tidak seperti itu, mereka berbeda. mereka telah meningkat secara khusus tetapi turun pada tahun 2012. mereka berada di 40% pada tahun 2009- 80% pada tahun 2010. mereka terus meningkat menjadi 100% dan sama dengan manusia pada tahun 2011</p><p></p><br />

Just like magic, I will be flying free
I am disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling , What you gonna say ?
