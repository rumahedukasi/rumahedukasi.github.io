Nasi goreng (fried rice) and sate (satay) dominated sales at Indonesia Festival 2017 that was held at the Hermitage Garden, Moscow, Russia from August 4 to 6.
“The Ladies’ Club booth was one of the most popular booths at the 2nd Indonesia Festival. Ever since day one, the iconic Indonesian cuisines had been favorites among Russians,” explained tourism ministry's deputy minister for overseas promotion, I Gde Pitana.
Around 40 small and medium enterprises (UKM) and restaurant chains from Indonesia took part in the festival which highlighted the theme “Visit Wonderful Indonesia: Enjoy its Diversity.”

The event was initiated by the tourism ministry in partnership with the Indonesian Embassy in Russia. An array of Indonesian cuisines such as nasi goreng, sate ayam (chicken satay), sate kambing (mutton satay), mie goreng (fried noodle) and tahu isi (stuffed tofu) was offered to visitors. 
“The food was out of stock even before the evening, some Russians were seen asking for nasi goreng,” Pitana added.
Apart from main courses, some of the booths also offered tropical fruits that are rarely found in Russia such as mango, papaya and jackfruit.
The festival aimed to improve the brand awareness of Wonderful Indonesia in Russia.
“Russia is one our target markets, the number of tourists from this country has been increasing significantly. Our target for this year is 108,000 people,” Pitana said.
Throughout the months of January until May this year, 52.189 Russian tourists were recorded to have visited Indonesia. It’s an increase of 62.14 percent from the same period last year that had 32,187 people.
The income per capita in Russia reaches $47,000, the country also has the policy of six-week annual leave for employees.

At the festival, the ministry also promoted Indonesian destinations to visitors.
“Indonesia Pavilion also showcased a carnival and art show from Malang Flower Carnival. The choosing of theme, attractions and shows were part of tourism ministry’s efforts to encourage tourists to learn about Indonesia and increase the interest of Russian people to travel to Indonesia,” said the ministry's deputy assistant for Europe, the United States, Middle East and Africa tourism promotion, Nia Niscaya.
“Russia has a very long winter period, hence its people are looking to travel to beach destinations and Indonesia is the home for these destinations. Let’s use the event to attract Russians to come to Indonesia, let them fall for Indonesian food first and then they’ll go to tourist destinations in Indonesia,” said tourism minister Arief Yahya.

                                            Why is Rupiah bill valuable? After all, you can't eat it. You can't wear it. It's just a piece of paper But you can trade dollars for things that you can eat or wear. The bills are worth something because everyone agrees that they have value WHAT IS MONEY? Money is anything that is widely exchanged for goods people sell or work they do. It is a form of payment people will accept. Long ago, precious metals such as gold and silver were used as money. Today, paper bills and coins are a common form of money Money has other uses, too. One of them is to measure the value of things Bicycles, clothes, even the food have a certain value. That value is the price- how much money people will pay for it. Money is also a way people store up wealth. People save their money in bank accounts or piggy banks. Saving money is a way of collecting and storing wealth, much like owning land, a home, or jewelry MONEY AROUND THE WORLD Most countries have their own unit of money. The money used by a country is called its currency. In the United States, the basic unit of money, or currency, is the dollar. Each dollar is divided into 100 cents. The value of anything you want to buy in the United States can be stated in dollars and cents. Other countries have their own currencies. In the United Kingdom, the value of things is measured in money units called pounds, not dollars. Algerians use neither pounds nor dollars, but dinars Indians use rupees. Mexicans use pesos. Russians use rubles MANY KINDS OF MONEY Money is more than just paper bills and metal coins. It can be just about anything, as long as everyone agrees Over the course of history, many items have been used as money Shells, beads, furs, salt- even the teeth of dogs- have all been used as money. They were used much like we use bills and coins today. HOW WAS MONEY INVENTED? No one person came up with the idea of money The idea developed slowly Before money was invented, people traded goods using the barter system.​</a>

Nasi goreng (fried rice) and sate (satay) dominated sales at Indonesia Festival 2017 that was held at the Hermitage Garden, Moscow, Russia from August 4 to 6.
“The Ladies’ Club booth was one of the most popular booths at the 2nd Indonesia Festival. Ever since day one, the iconic Indonesian cuisines had been favorites among Russians,” explained tourism ministry's deputy minister for overseas promotion, I Gde Pitana.
Around 40 small and medium enterprises (UKM) and restaurant chains from Indonesia took part in the festival which highlighted the theme “Visit Wonderful Indonesia: Enjoy its Diversity.”

The event was initiated by the tourism ministry in partnership with the Indonesian Embassy in Russia. An array of Indonesian cuisines such as nasi goreng, sate ayam (chicken satay), sate kambing (mutton satay), mie goreng (fried noodle) and tahu isi (stuffed tofu) was offered to visitors. 
“The food was out of stock even before the evening, some Russians were seen asking for nasi goreng,” Pitana added.
Apart from main courses, some of the booths also offered tropical fruits that are rarely found in Russia such as mango, papaya and jackfruit.
The festival aimed to improve the brand awareness of Wonderful Indonesia in Russia.
“Russia is one our target markets, the number of tourists from this country has been increasing significantly. Our target for this year is 108,000 people,” Pitana said.
Throughout the months of January until May this year, 52.189 Russian tourists were recorded to have visited Indonesia. It’s an increase of 62.14 percent from the same period last year that had 32,187 people.
The income per capita in Russia reaches $47,000, the country also has the policy of six-week annual leave for employees.

At the festival, the ministry also promoted Indonesian destinations to visitors.
“Indonesia Pavilion also showcased a carnival and art show from Malang Flower Carnival. The choosing of theme, attractions and shows were part of tourism ministry’s efforts to encourage tourists to learn about Indonesia and increase the interest of Russian people to travel to Indonesia,” said the ministry's deputy assistant for Europe, the United States, Middle East and Africa tourism promotion, Nia Niscaya.
“Russia has a very long winter period, hence its people are looking to travel to beach destinations and Indonesia is the home for these destinations. Let’s use the event to attract Russians to come to Indonesia, let them fall for Indonesian food first and then they’ll go to tourist destinations in Indonesia,” said tourism minister Arief Yahya.

                            6. Why is Rupiah bill valuable? After all, you can't eat it. You can't wear it. It's just a piece of paper But you can trade dollars for things that you can eat or wear. The bills are worth something because everyone agrees that they have value WHAT IS MONEY? Money is anything that is widely exchanged for goods people sell or work they do. It is a form of payment people will accept. Long ago, precious metals such as gold and silver were used as money. Today, paper bills and coins are a common form of money Money has other uses, too. One of them is to measure the value of things Bicycles, clothes, even the food have a certain value. That value is the price- how much money people will pay for it. Money is also a way people store up wealth. People save their money in bank accounts or piggy banks. Saving money is a way of collecting and storing wealth, much like owning land, a home, or jewelry MONEY AROUND THE WORLD Most countries have their own unit of money. The money used by a country is called its currency. In the United States, the basic unit of money, or currency, is the dollar. Each dollar is divided into 100 cents. The value of anything you want to buy in the United States can be stated in dollars and cents. Other countries have their own currencies. In the United Kingdom, the value of things is measured in money units called pounds, not dollars. Algerians use neither pounds nor dollars, but dinars Indians use rupees. Mexicans use pesos. Russians use rubles MANY KINDS OF MONEY Money is more than just paper bills and metal coins. It can be just about anything, as long as everyone agrees Over the course of history, many items have been used as money Shells, beads, furs, salt- even the teeth of dogs- have all been used as money. They were used much like we use bills and coins today. HOW WAS MONEY INVENTED? No one person came up with the idea of money The idea developed slowly Before money was invented, people traded goods using the barter system.​</h2><br />
                        <p> Money is valuable because it is widely accepted as a means of exchange for goods and services. While it is true that money itself cannot be eaten or worn, it represents the value that people place on those things. Money can take many forms, including precious metals like gold and silver, and today, paper bills and coins are a common form of money. Money is also used to measure the value of things, and people save it as a way of storing wealth.</p><p> Different countries have their own currencies, which are used to measure the value of things in those countries. For example, the United States uses the dollar, while the United Kingdom uses the pound. Money has been invented over time, with different items being used as money throughout history, such as shells, beads, furs, and even dog teeth. Before money was invented, people traded goods using the barter system.</p><br />
