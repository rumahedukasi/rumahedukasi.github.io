                                            We alewg to complain about ads on TV There are so many ads, especially duringour favorite programs we think they should be stopped for a number of reasonsFirst, ads are a nuisance. They go on for a long time and there are so many Sometimesthere seems to be too many ads in one programSecond, ads are a bad influence on people. They try to encourage people to buyunhealthy food like beer, soft drink candy and chips. And they make people want things theydo not really need and can't afford. It can lead to consumerismFinally, the people who make ads have too much say in program people watch That'sbecause they want to put all of their ads on popular program that a lot of people watch Someprograms that are not so popular get stopped because they do not attract enough ads eventhough those programs may be some one's favoriteFor those reasons, we think your TV station should stop showing ads. They interruptprograms. They are bad influence on people, and they are sometimes put a stop to people'sfavorite shows. We are sick of ads, and now we mostly watch other channelsYours truly,Sabrina1.What does the text tell about?2.What is the writer's suggestion ?​</a>

                                            TOLONG YA Sofia : How bad is urbanization back in your country? Tom : What do you mean how bad? As far as I know, we don't have this problem In big cities, people are moving out to the country, instead. Sofia : Really? That's interesting. How can that happen? Tom : Well, people are fed up with all the problems of city life. I suppose. They want to get rid of all these problems such as pollution, traffic jams, crime. you name it.Sofia : Gee. That's nice. Tom : Is it very bad here? Sofia: Bad? Horrible! From our geography class, we learn up to twelve percent of people from the country move to the cities. Remember this: In the past, more than 90 percent of Indonesian people lived in the country. Now, less than 70 percent do.Tom : Yeah. Sounds bad. Well. we cannot blame them, can we? Sofia : No. Busy places naturally attract people. As long as you are creative, you can find jobs. Near your house, you can get anything you want Compare it with country life. Tom : It's not comparable. Say, jobs, for example. There are less jobs the country. Farming is a great job, if you really are into it. That if you are that short of person. Sofia : That's just the problem. The young people here are not patient enough. Work in the country does not give them instant cash. I must admit I made a foolish mistake to advise my housekeeper take her relatives coming to town to look for better jobs. I mean to help them. Tom : You did? Sent them here? Sofia : I honestly regret it. I never thought they'd take their other relatives.Tom : Well, that's such pity. Sofia : I assure you it's true. I promised my selt l'd never do it again. I regret it you know Tom : Too bad.Sofia : Now some of them are back. They are working for a farm owner who raises fish and poultry. They don't get that much money, but they feel safer and happier. Tom : Wise of them. Don't you think that the government needs to do better, here? Sofia : Yes, the government should develop business in the countries and other facilities, too. Now, it's up to us, the young people. We can make our own living in the village. The country offers us opportunity as broad as the city does. Tom : And don't be surprised if the future people are moving from the city to the country.​</a>

                                            The world is a [cruel] place, it's dark and lonely. People today are just too busy to entertain other people, some don't even want them to be entertained. Even some of our family member are busy and don't want to do anything that is entertaining right now because, they have work to do. I know work is important but, feeling joy is also important. At school however, things are just weird and wrong. There are bullys and embarrassment, we got laugh at and got mad at. Some people wanted to do suicide because of all of this, and some is brave enough to do it that people are already too late to help that hopeless and desperate person. But remember, solving cruelty with cruelty doesn't solve anything because it's only making it worst. You we're brought to life by God with a reason, you just don't know it yet. So don't kill yourself or just give up life, or else you won't find the reason of why you we're brought to life by God. Everything has a reason, even things that are not that useful. So what ever you do, you must be kind to others. Who knows one day, You will find the reason of why you we're brought to life by God.The caged word means...​</a>

                                            1. Read the following text then underline the sentence or word that contains degree of comparison! There is always something amazing in life if we just spend some times to consider it. When we face problems, always believe that there will be brighter day lay ahead. There will always be better day than what we had once faced. Rainbow will come after rain and storm. The day is more beautiful with the rainbow. The simplest way to enjoy our lives is by showing our gratitude to Allah, God Almighty. Show gratitude to the little and small thing in our lives, and Allah will grand as with the more and bigger blessing that we never predict before. Always believe that we are not alone. We have our family and friends, and above all, we have Allah. Everything happens in our lives for a purpose. People may call it coincidence. But when we consider it more, it's all in a bigger plan, Allah's plan, the best plan ever. Anything happens in our lives on time, never sooner or late. It happens and comes when we need it not when we want it. So, keep praying and believing that Allah's help and blessing will come to us whenever we need it, always. Answer:​</a>

                                            Why You Should Not Smoke I am sure that you know that smoking harms your body. Then why do you continue smoking? Maybe you do it because you haven’t really become conscious about all the effects that smoking has. There are a lot of reasons why you shouldn’t smoke. Some of them are that smoking affects your health, that you spend a lot of money on cigarettes, and that when you smoke you are not respecting people around you. The first reason why you shouldn’t smoke is that smoking affects your health. If you smoke, your physical condition will be negatively affected, so it will be very difficult for you to succeed in sports. Also, smoking produces lethal diseases like cancer and reduces the length and quality of your life. Maybe you don’t notice all the physical effects of smoking immediately, but you surely will be sorry one day. The second reason why you shouldn’t smoke is because of all the money that you spend on it. Maybe you start smoking only when someone offers you a cigarette, but there will be a day when you will feel the need of a cigarette. By this time, you will pay whatever to smoke, an each time you will smoke more, so you will spend more money. All the money you would spend on cigars could have be spent in something better, don’t you think? The last reason why you shouldn’t smoke is out of respect for the people around you. When you smoke, you not only harm yourself, but you also harm all the people around you. So you mustn’t be selfish; you should at least avoid smoking in front of people who don’t smoke. Also, many people don’t like the cigarette’s smell, so they won’t enjoy your company. Would you like that? I have said just some reasons of why you shouldn’t smoke, so I hope that now those of you who smoke are able to think a little and try to make a smart decision. In addition to all the reasons I’ve said, I would like you to think about how much you love yourself and then whether you want to continue harming yourself. Think also about all the people who love you, like your family who doesn’t want to see you suffering or sick. If you decide to continue smoking, what a pity. But if you decide to stop smoking, congratulations! Remember that "If you can dream it, you can do it. -- The first reason why you shouldn’t smoke is that smoking affects your health.

                                            lInternet PrivacyThere are many social media sites today. On social media sites, users may develop biographical profiles, communicate with friends and strangers, do reanarch, shop, and share thoughts, photos, music, links, and more. It means intemet is used for a wide variety of needs every day. Do you make your account or site private? Internet privacy is important today it means keeping your data private on the internet. The main benefit of internet privacy is that it allows individuals to remain anonymous should they choose to be. However, there are some pros and cons of intemet privacy.We need Internet privacy, it allows online protection. Since we are all using online media to connect, our data must be secured. Logging into the internet allows some people to be identified. It means tracking their movements online. Therefore, we need to protect our data. Apart from our financial information, there are photos and videos that shouldn't end up in the wrong hands. Internet privacy encourages the freedom of speech. If we want to report something in our area, we need our freedom of speech to get help. We can comment about a topic. These comments are open and transparent. sites, for example, people can be unfollowed or blocked and not necessarily even realize it. Certain news items can also be blocked.On the other hand, there are some cons of internet privacy. While online privacy is a good thing and it protects you from cybercrime, it can help criminals. It is easy to create fake privacy is protected, nobody can see his/her true identity. Thus he/she is free to do whatever he/she When someone's wants. He/she may do cyberbullying, cybercrimes, or criminals. Due to internet privacy, it is difficult for people to get to know other people. It is also easier for people to assume the identity of someone else. Another disadvantage is that source materials must be verified to be authentic. There are many sites that offer false information that is often treated as real. In conclusion, the pros and cons of internet privacy show us that something must have goodand bad. In my opinion, we need internet privacy. Unless we use internet privacy, we will be the target of hackers.1. What is the text about?2. What can people do on social media sites?3.

Clothes today are very different from clothes of the 1800s. One difference is the way they look. For example, in 1800s all women wore dresses. The dresses all had long skirts. But today women do not always wear dresses with long skirts. Sometime they wear short skirts and sometime they wear pants. Another difference between 1800s and today is the cloth. They were made from cotton, wool, silk and linen. But today, there are many kind of man-made cloth. A lot of clothes are now made of nylon, rayon, or polyester.

                                            Most people avoid eating dangerous foods. They don’t want to get sick. However, there’s one food that can be deadly, yet some people eat it in one purpose. It’s called the puffer fish. The kind of fish, called Fugu in Japanese, lives in the Pacific Ocean. Some people die every year from eating fugu. In fact, the Emperor of Japan is not allowed to touch it. Why? Well, the inside of the puffer fish are very poisonous. They contain poison 275 times more powerful than the deadly poison cyanide Usually nothing bad happens when fugu is on a restaurant’s menu. Customers feel great after the meal. That’s because chefs are trained to remove the inside of the puffer fish before they give it to customers. If they miss even a small amount, the fish is not safe to eat. Puffer fish is very expensive. A plat of fugu costs more than $200 in some restaurants in Tokyo. Besides being dangerous to eat, the fish is very ugly, with spines all over its body. Also, it can puff, or blow, itself up to double its normal size. Why do the Japanese risk so much for such an ugly and dangerous fish? Well, some people like taking risks. And fugu tastes wonderful.1. What does the text tell about?2. Where does ‘Fugu” live?3. Why are the inside of the puffer fish very poisonous?4. What is the purpose of the text above? 5.

A. Finally, some scientists believe that cloning has many disadvantages. For example, cloned ones get older faster, and live shorter. On the other hand, we shouldn’t forget that it is a very new technology and it needs some time to be improved. I believe that after a while and after worked on seriously, it will really provide us the advantages that I mentioned before, so I think at this moment, all we can do is to wait and see what our scientists can do. 
C . Cloning 
D. First of all, even in our time, we still have some illnesses that have no cure or treatment or that have long and painful treatments that are applied with difficulty. We can give leukemia as an example. In the treatment of leukemia, you have to find a person whose tissues match those of the person suffering from leukemia, and the probability is very low, unless they are identical twins. If we use the cloning technology in these cases, we can find a solution to these kinds of diseases easily. Therefore, I think if it has such advantages why shouldn’t it be used? 
E. Secondly, if we use this technology in the birth of children, we not only decrease the risks of cancer, stroke and dementia, but also increase the cognitive potential and talents of children, as Lee Silver mentioned in his article. I want to say that the quality of new generation will increase, so better lives are waiting for us at least for our children, after we improve and start cloning 
F. Do you want a twin that is cloned from you? Do you think it is necessary? Or do you think it is unethical and should be banned? I strongly believe that cloning is a new technology that is necessary for our world. I have various reasons for this: it is necessary for the treatment of some illnesses such as leukemia and it provides our children better lives. Some people claim that cloning causes some disadvantages, but I think they are really making a mistake. 
B. To sum up, in my opinion, cloning will really help us, maybe not today, but definitely tomorrow. Because of this reason, I really wait for tomorrow impatiently. </a>

                                            Talaga Warna
Long ago there was a kingdom in West Java. The kingdom was ruled by a king called 
Prabu.Prabu was a kind and wise king, and there was no hunger in his kingdom. But Prabu 
and his queen didn’t have any children. It made them very, very sad.
Then one day Prabu went into the jungle. There he prayed to his god for a child. A 
few months later, the queen was expecting a baby, and all the people in the kingdom were 
happy. Prabu and the queen loved their little daughter and gave her everything. Th is made 
the princess a very spoiled girl. If she didn’t get what she wanted, she became very angry. 
But even though the princess behaved badly, her parents loved her, and so did the people 
in the kingdom.
Day by day, the princess grew more beautiful. When she was 17, her parents invited 
all the people in the kingdom to a party. Prabu took their gift s of gold and bright jewels and 
had a beautiful necklace made for his daughter.
On the day of the birthday, people gathered in the palace field. When Prabu and the 
queen appeared, people welcomed them happily. The cheers were even louder when the 
beautiful princess appeared. Prabu took the necklace. “My beloved daughter,” he said, 
“today I give this necklace to you. It is a gift from the people of this country because they 
love you so much.”The princess looked at the necklace. “I don’t want it! It’s ugly!” she 
shouted, and she threw the necklace on the ground, where it broke into pieces. Everyone 
was shocked. Nobody spoke.They never thought that their beloved princess would do that 
terrible thing.
In their silence people heard the queen crying. Everyone was sad and began crying, 
too. A pool of water formed on the ground. Soon the pool became a big lake. The lake sank 
all of the kingdom.
Today, people called the lake Talaga Warna. It means ‘Lake of Colours’. It is located 
in Puncak, West Java. On a bright day, the lake is full of amazing colours, which in fact come 
from the reflection of the trees and flowers around it. But some people believe that the 
colours are from the princess’s necklace, which still lies in pieces at the bottom of the lake.

We alewg to complain about ads on TV There are so many ads, especially duringour favorite programs we think they should be stopped for a number of reasonsFirst, ads are a nuisance. They go on for a long time and there are so many Sometimesthere seems to be too many ads in one programSecond, ads are a bad influence on people. They try to encourage people to buyunhealthy food like beer, soft drink candy and chips. And they make people want things theydo not really need and can't afford. It can lead to consumerismFinally, the people who make ads have too much say in program people watch That'sbecause they want to put all of their ads on popular program that a lot of people watch Someprograms that are not so popular get stopped because they do not attract enough ads eventhough those programs may be some one's favoriteFor those reasons, we think your TV station should stop showing ads. They interruptprograms. They are bad influence on people, and they are sometimes put a stop to people'sfavorite shows.

                            5. TOLONG YA Sofia : How bad is urbanization back in your country? Tom : What do you mean how bad? As far as I know, we don't have this problem In big cities, people are moving out to the country, instead. Sofia : Really? That's interesting. How can that happen? Tom : Well, people are fed up with all the problems of city life. I suppose. They want to get rid of all these problems such as pollution, traffic jams, crime. you name it.Sofia : Gee. That's nice. Tom : Is it very bad here? Sofia: Bad? Horrible! From our geography class, we learn up to twelve percent of people from the country move to the cities. Remember this: In the past, more than 90 percent of Indonesian people lived in the country. Now, less than 70 percent do.Tom : Yeah. Sounds bad. Well. we cannot blame them, can we? Sofia : No. Busy places naturally attract people. As long as you are creative, you can find jobs. Near your house, you can get anything you want Compare it with country life. Tom : It's not comparable. Say, jobs, for example. There are less jobs the country. Farming is a great job, if you really are into it. That if you are that short of person. Sofia : That's just the problem. The young people here are not patient enough. Work in the country does not give them instant cash. I must admit I made a foolish mistake to advise my housekeeper take her relatives coming to town to look for better jobs. I mean to help them. Tom : You did? Sent them here? Sofia : I honestly regret it. I never thought they'd take their other relatives.Tom : Well, that's such pity. Sofia : I assure you it's true. I promised my selt l'd never do it again. I regret it you know Tom : Too bad.Sofia : Now some of them are back. They are working for a farm owner who raises fish and poultry. They don't get that much money, but they feel safer and happier. Tom : Wise of them. Don't you think that the government needs to do better, here? Sofia : Yes, the government should develop business in the countries and other facilities, too. Now, it's up to us, the young people. We can make our own living in the village. The country offers us opportunity as broad as the city does. Tom : And don't be surprised if the future people are moving from the city to the country.​</h2><br />

                            11. 1. Read the following text then underline the sentence or word that contains degree of comparison! There is always something amazing in life if we just spend some times to consider it. When we face problems, always believe that there will be brighter day lay ahead. There will always be better day than what we had once faced. Rainbow will come after rain and storm. The day is more beautiful with the rainbow. The simplest way to enjoy our lives is by showing our gratitude to Allah, God Almighty. Show gratitude to the little and small thing in our lives, and Allah will grand as with the more and bigger blessing that we never predict before. Always believe that we are not alone. We have our family and friends, and above all, we have Allah. Everything happens in our lives for a purpose. People may call it coincidence. But when we consider it more, it's all in a bigger plan, Allah's plan, the best plan ever. Anything happens in our lives on time, never sooner or late. It happens and comes when we need it not when we want it. So, keep praying and believing that Allah's help and blessing will come to us whenever we need it, always. Answer:​</h2><br />

                            13. Why You Should Not Smoke I am sure that you know that smoking harms your body. Then why do you continue smoking? Maybe you do it because you haven’t really become conscious about all the effects that smoking has. There are a lot of reasons why you shouldn’t smoke. Some of them are that smoking affects your health, that you spend a lot of money on cigarettes, and that when you smoke you are not respecting people around you. The first reason why you shouldn’t smoke is that smoking affects your health. If you smoke, your physical condition will be negatively affected, so it will be very difficult for you to succeed in sports. Also, smoking produces lethal diseases like cancer and reduces the length and quality of your life. Maybe you don’t notice all the physical effects of smoking immediately, but you surely will be sorry one day. The second reason why you shouldn’t smoke is because of all the money that you spend on it. Maybe you start smoking only when someone offers you a cigarette, but there will be a day when you will feel the need of a cigarette. By this time, you will pay whatever to smoke, an each time you will smoke more, so you will spend more money. All the money you would spend on cigars could have be spent in something better, don’t you think? The last reason why you shouldn’t smoke is out of respect for the people around you. When you smoke, you not only harm yourself, but you also harm all the people around you. So you mustn’t be selfish; you should at least avoid smoking in front of people who don’t smoke. Also, many people don’t like the cigarette’s smell, so they won’t enjoy your company. Would you like that? I have said just some reasons of why you shouldn’t smoke, so I hope that now those of you who smoke are able to think a little and try to make a smart decision. In addition to all the reasons I’ve said, I would like you to think about how much you love yourself and then whether you want to continue harming yourself. Think also about all the people who love you, like your family who doesn’t want to see you suffering or sick. If you decide to continue smoking, what a pity. But if you decide to stop smoking, congratulations! Remember that "If you can dream it, you can do it. -- The first reason why you shouldn’t smoke is that smoking affects your health.

                            19. Most people avoid eating dangerous foods. They don’t want to get sick. However, there’s one food that can be deadly, yet some people eat it in one purpose. It’s called the puffer fish. The kind of fish, called Fugu in Japanese, lives in the Pacific Ocean. Some people die every year from eating fugu. In fact, the Emperor of Japan is not allowed to touch it. Why? Well, the inside of the puffer fish are very poisonous. They contain poison 275 times more powerful than the deadly poison cyanide Usually nothing bad happens when fugu is on a restaurant’s menu. Customers feel great after the meal. That’s because chefs are trained to remove the inside of the puffer fish before they give it to customers. If they miss even a small amount, the fish is not safe to eat. Puffer fish is very expensive. A plat of fugu costs more than $200 in some restaurants in Tokyo. Besides being dangerous to eat, the fish is very ugly, with spines all over its body. Also, it can puff, or blow, itself up to double its normal size. Why do the Japanese risk so much for such an ugly and dangerous fish? Well, some people like taking risks.

                            28. Reorganize the following jumbled paragraphs on an exposition text. Rewrite the result of reorganization in the space provided.
A. Finally, some scientists believe that cloning has many disadvantages. For example, cloned ones get older faster, and live shorter. On the other hand, we shouldn’t forget that it is a very new technology and it needs some time to be improved. I believe that after a while and after worked on seriously, it will really provide us the advantages that I mentioned before, so I think at this moment, all we can do is to wait and see what our scientists can do. 
C . Cloning 
D. First of all, even in our time, we still have some illnesses that have no cure or treatment or that have long and painful treatments that are applied with difficulty. We can give leukemia as an example. In the treatment of leukemia, you have to find a person whose tissues match those of the person suffering from leukemia, and the probability is very low, unless they are identical twins. If we use the cloning technology in these cases, we can find a solution to these kinds of diseases easily. Therefore, I think if it has such advantages why shouldn’t it be used? 
E. Secondly, if we use this technology in the birth of children, we not only decrease the risks of cancer, stroke and dementia, but also increase the cognitive potential and talents of children, as Lee Silver mentioned in his article. I want to say that the quality of new generation will increase, so better lives are waiting for us at least for our children, after we improve and start cloning 
F. Do you want a twin that is cloned from you? Do you think it is necessary? Or do you think it is unethical and should be banned? I strongly believe that cloning is a new technology that is necessary for our world. I have various reasons for this: it is necessary for the treatment of some illnesses such as leukemia and it provides our children better lives. Some people claim that cloning causes some disadvantages, but I think they are really making a mistake. 
B. To sum up, in my opinion, cloning will really help us, maybe not today, but definitely tomorrow. Because of this reason, I really wait for tomorrow impatiently. </h2><br />

                            31. Talaga Warna
Long ago there was a kingdom in West Java. The kingdom was ruled by a king called 
Prabu.Prabu was a kind and wise king, and there was no hunger in his kingdom. But Prabu 
and his queen didn’t have any children. It made them very, very sad.
Then one day Prabu went into the jungle. There he prayed to his god for a child. A 
few months later, the queen was expecting a baby, and all the people in the kingdom were 
happy. Prabu and the queen loved their little daughter and gave her everything. Th is made 
the princess a very spoiled girl. If she didn’t get what she wanted, she became very angry. 
But even though the princess behaved badly, her parents loved her, and so did the people 
in the kingdom.
Day by day, the princess grew more beautiful. When she was 17, her parents invited 
all the people in the kingdom to a party. Prabu took their gift s of gold and bright jewels and 
had a beautiful necklace made for his daughter.
On the day of the birthday, people gathered in the palace field. When Prabu and the 
queen appeared, people welcomed them happily. The cheers were even louder when the 
beautiful princess appeared. Prabu took the necklace. “My beloved daughter,” he said, 
“today I give this necklace to you. It is a gift from the people of this country because they 
love you so much.”The princess looked at the necklace. “I don’t want it! It’s ugly!” she 
shouted, and she threw the necklace on the ground, where it broke into pieces. Everyone 
was shocked. Nobody spoke.They never thought that their beloved princess would do that 
terrible thing.
In their silence people heard the queen crying. Everyone was sad and began crying, 
too. A pool of water formed on the ground. Soon the pool became a big lake. The lake sank 
all of the kingdom.
Today, people called the lake Talaga Warna. It means ‘Lake of Colours’. It is located 
in Puncak, West Java. On a bright day, the lake is full of amazing colours, which in fact come 
from the reflection of the trees and flowers around it. But some people believe that the 
colours are from the princess’s necklace, which still lies in pieces at the bottom of the lake.

Kreatif sih kalau menurutku, karena di teks nya itu dia menambahkan hal" yang imut dan lucu untuk mendekor tempat pensil nya, asalkan cocok satu sama lain, why not? </p><p>10. sinonim nya adalah sparkle/shimmer. yang artinya adalah berkilau. btw itu kan nggak ada yang di garis bawahi, jadi aku fikir kata" yang di garis bawahi itu glitter. kalau misalkan salah silahkan dikoreksi, aku jawab nanti di kolom komentar. </p><p></p><p>Semoga membantu ya :))</p><br />
