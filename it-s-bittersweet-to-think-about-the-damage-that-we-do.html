I have to submit ittomorrow but I'm still confused about it. That's why I am here to findsome references for my assignmentTiara What is the assignment about?Jane It is about a paper that discuss about environmental issues. Do you haveany idea?TiaraWell it seems to me that global warming will be an interesting topic. Somany campaigns have been done to stop global warming. Right?JaneThat's a great idea. However, I don't know exactly what globalwarming is and how it happens.Tiara As far as I know, it is the condition in which the earth temperature isgradually increasing and if it keeps happening. It will damage the ozonlayer that filters the ultraviolet ray from the sun. Eventually, it willendanger the life on earth.Jane It sounds terrible, what is your view about the cause of global warming?Tiara In my opinion, the biggest cause of global warming is the increasednumber of illegal logging which has happened over time. It decreases thenumber of trees in our country and it is really dangerous.Illegal logging? How come?Tiara: Well, Jane. You know that trees are the biggest producer of Oz oroxygen in the world, if we only have few trees, CO2 or carbon dioxidecan make the earth getting hotter.JaneOh, that's absolutely right. Do you think there are other causes thatcontribute to global warming?Tiara : Yes, Jane. I think any actions that produce CO2 contribute to globalwarming. You can find further information on the internet.Jane : As I see it, we should do real actions to prevent global warming.JaneTrans late ke bahasa Indonesia​</a>

Farah is talking to Risma while watching TV. 
Farah : Our earth is getting hotter. It’s because of 
global warming.
Risma : Yeah. Then, what should we do? Any idea?
Farah : Hmmm. I think we must do prohibition to 
use the vehicles or stop factory activities 
that damage the river for a while.
Risma : Umm. .... Your idea is too excessive. 
It’s impossible. I think we must do 
reforestation along way and cooperate 
with many people to make it happen.

I have to submit ittomorrow but I'm still confused about it. That's why I am here to findsome references for my assignmentTiara What is the assignment about?Jane It is about a paper that discuss about environmental issues. Do you haveany idea?TiaraWell it seems to me that global warming will be an interesting topic. Somany campaigns have been done to stop global warming. Right?JaneThat's a great idea. However, I don't know exactly what globalwarming is and how it happens.Tiara As far as I know, it is the condition in which the earth temperature isgradually increasing and if it keeps happening. It will damage the ozonlayer that filters the ultraviolet ray from the sun. Eventually, it willendanger the life on earth.Jane It sounds terrible, what is your view about the cause of global warming?Tiara In my opinion, the biggest cause of global warming is the increasednumber of illegal logging which has happened over time. It decreases thenumber of trees in our country and it is really dangerous.Illegal logging? How come?Tiara: Well, Jane. You know that trees are the biggest producer of Oz oroxygen in the world, if we only have few trees, CO2 or carbon dioxidecan make the earth getting hotter.JaneOh, that's absolutely right. Do you think there are other causes thatcontribute to global warming?Tiara : Yes, Jane. I think any actions that produce CO2 contribute to globalwarming. You can find further information on the internet.Jane : As I see it, we should do real actions to prevent global warming.JaneTrans late ke bahasa Indonesia​</h2><br />
