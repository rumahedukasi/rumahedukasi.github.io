                                            A sinkhole is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer of the earth. Most are caused by karst processes— for example, the chemical dissolution of carbonate rocks or suffusion processes. Sinkholes vary in size from 1 to 600 m (3.3 to 2,000 ft) both in diameter and depth. They also vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms. They may form gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide.
The formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock (such as limestone) by percolating water, the collapse of a cave roof, or a lowering of the water table. Sinkholes often form through the process of suffusion. For example, groundwater may dissolve the carbonate cement holding the sandstone particles together and then carry away the lax particles, gradually forming a void.

                                            The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum recognised as 'the jewel of Muslim art in India'. It is regarded as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture an amalgamation of Persian, Turkish and Indian styles. The most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, is the main gate, which stands majestically in the centre of the southern wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the north front by double arcade galleries. The garden in front of the galleries is subdivided into four quarters by two main walkways and each quarters in turn subdivided by the narrower cross-axial walkways, on the Timurid-Persian scheme of the @2020, Direktorat SMA, Direktorat Jenderal PAUD, DIKDAS dan DIKMEN Modul Bahasa Inggris.Kelas X KD 3.4/4.4 walled in garden. The enclosure walls on the east and west have a pavilion at the centre. The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones. The mosque and the guest house in the Taj Mahal complex are built of red sandstone in contrast to the marble tomb in the centre. Both the buildings have a large platform over the terrace at their front. Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical structures. They have an oblong massive prayer hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a row with central dominant portal. The frame of the portal arches and the spandrels are veneered in white marble. The spandrels are filled with flowery arabesques of stone intarsia and the arches bordered with rope molding. The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Qur'anic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal.butuh jawabannya​</a>

It is not surprising that it has been designated as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.The walls of the canyon are made of limestone, sandstone, lava, and other rocks. As the day passes, the rocks reflect different colors. Many tourists come to the Canyon just to watch the rocks change color.Cottonwood and willow trees grow at the bottom of the Canyon. Many varieties of cactus grow here as well. The Canyon is also home to many animals, such as bobcats, coyotes, kangaroo rats, and deer.About 4 million visitors come to the Grand Canyon each year.

                                            A sinkhole is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer of the earth. Most are caused by karst processes— for example, the chemical dissolution of carbonate rocks or suffusion processes. 
Sinkholes vary in size from 1 to 600 m (3.3 to 2,000 ft) both in diameter and depth. They also vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms. They may form gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide.
The formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock (such as limestone) by percolating water, the collapse of a cave roof, or a lowering of the water table. Sinkholes often form through the process of suffusion. For example, groundwater may dissolve the carbonate cement holding the sandstone particles together and then carry away the lax particles, gradually forming a void.
What is the main cause of the formation of sinkhole? 
A. Collapsing of caves roof
B. Suffusion process
C. Erosion process
D. Karst process</a>

                                            Taj Mahal has become one of the most famous tourist sites in India. It is called the Taj Mahal, meaning “Crown of the Palace”. It is located in Agra. Agra is a city in north central India. Work on the tomb began in 1632. It took more than twenty years to build. Shah Jahan hired 20.000 men to construct the palace-like tomb. The building is made of white marble and sits on a base of red sandstone. There are tall at each corner of the building. The minarets tilt slightly away from the building. This is so they will not fall on the tomb in the event of an earthquake. A huge dome was constructed over the center of the building. Precious stones were placed into the walls. They make the tomb sparkle at different times of the day. A special style of writing called calligraphy decorates the walls of the tomb. A long water pool was built outside the building and lined with trees and flowers. At certain times of the day, the beautiful Taj Mahal is reflected in the pool. The colors of the tomb change. They are pinkish in the morning, white in the evening and golden colors when the moon shines. Today, the bodies of shah Jahan and his wife lie beside one another in this monument to love.

                                            The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum recognised as 'the jewel of Muslim art in India'. It is regarded as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture – an amalgamation of Persian, Turkish and Indian styles. 
The most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, is the main gate, which stands majestically in the centre of the southern wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the north front by double arcade galleries. The garden in front of the galleries is subdivided into four quarters by two main walkways and each quarters in turn subdivided by the narrower cross-axial walkways, on the Timurid-Persian scheme of thewalled in garden. The enclosure walls on the east and west have a pavilion 
at the centre.
The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones. The mosque and the guest house in the Taj Mahal complex are built of red sandstone in contrast to the marble tomb in the centre. Both the buildings have a large platform over the terrace at their front. Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical structures. They have an oblong massive prayer hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a row with central dominant portal. The frame of the portal arches and the spandrels are veneered in white marble. The spandrels are filled with flowery arabesques of stone intarsia and the arches bordered with rope molding.
The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast 
Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District 
in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory 
of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and 
completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main 
gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added 
subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several 
historical and Qur’anic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting 
the chronology of Taj Mahal.</a>

                                            The plain of jars in north east laos, is one of the oldest archeological mysteries in southeast asia.
Located on the plateau of xieng khouang, in the mountains of indochina, there are about 90 different jars sites. Eacha site contains from 1 to 400 jars. It has been estimated that they were created 3,000 years ago, and are made of sandstone, limestone, granite, breccias and conglomerate, with the majority being made of sandstone. The tallest jar              is about 9 feet tall and all        are made from their own individual slab of stone.
At first glance the jars appear to be haphazardly placed, with some standing upright and others on their sides, pointing in different directions. Further studies have revealed that they are placed in positions that form the constellation patterns of the stars. There has been lots of specukation about the purpose of the jars -drinking glasses for a giant race, being used to collect rainwater, or as burial urns.
Mors of the jars are empty, but a few have been found with bodies or tools inside, or filled with miniature Buddha statues. Exploration is hard as the area is littered with unixploded  bombs from the secret war.

                                            Practice 1. Read out the text carefully. The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum recognized as 'the jewel of Muslim art in India'. It is regarded as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture - an amalgamation of Persian, Turkish and Indian styles. The most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, is the main gate, which stands majestically in the center of the southern wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the north front by double arcade galleries. The garden in front of the galleries is subdivided into four quarters by two main walkways and each quarter in turn subdivided by the narrower cross-axial walkways, on the Timurid-Persian scheme of the walled in garden. The enclosure walls on the east and west have a pavilion at the center. The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semiprecious stones. The mosque and the guest house in the Taj Mahal complexes are built of red sandstone in contrast to the marble tomb in the center. Both the buildings have a large platform over the terrace at their front. Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical structures. They have an oblong massive prayer hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a row with central dominant portal. The frame of the portal arches and the spandrels are veneered in white marble. The spandrels are filled with flowery arabesques of stone intarsia and the arches bordered with rope molding. The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Qur'anic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal.

                            7. A sinkhole is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer of the earth. Most are caused by karst processes— for example, the chemical dissolution of carbonate rocks or suffusion processes. Sinkholes vary in size from 1 to 600 m (3.3 to 2,000 ft) both in diameter and depth. They also vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms. They may form gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide.
The formation of sinkholes involves natural processes of erosion or gradual removal of slightly soluble bedrock (such as limestone) by percolating water, the collapse of a cave roof, or a lowering of the water table. Sinkholes often form through the process of suffusion. For example, groundwater may dissolve the carbonate cement holding the sandstone particles together and then carry away the lax particles, gradually forming a void.

Mereka juga bervariasi dalam bentuk dari mangkuk yang dilapisi tanah sampai jurang bermata tajam. Mereka dapat terbentuk secara bertahap atau tiba-tiba, dan ditemukan di seluruh dunia.<br /><br />Pembentukan sinkholes melibatkan proses alami dari erosi atau penghapusan bertahap bebatuan bebatuan yang sedikit larut (seperti batu kapur) dengan meresap air, runtuhnya atap gua, atau menurunkan permukaan air. Sinkhole sering terbentuk melalui proses sufusion. Sebagai contoh, air tanah dapat melarutkan semen karbonat yang menahan partikel batu pasir bersama-sama dan kemudian membawa partikel-partikel yang lemah, secara bertahap membentuk kekosongan.<br /><br />Apa penyebab utama pembentukan lubang pembuangan?<br />A. Ambruknya atap gua<br />B. Proses Suffusion<br />C. Proses erosi<br />D. Proses Karst<br /><br />jawaban : D. proses karst<br />

                            26. Taj Mahal has become one of the most famous tourist sites in India. It is called the Taj Mahal, meaning “Crown of the Palace”. It is located in Agra. Agra is a city in north central India. Work on the tomb began in 1632. It took more than twenty years to build. Shah Jahan hired 20.000 men to construct the palace-like tomb. The building is made of white marble and sits on a base of red sandstone. There are tall at each corner of the building. The minarets tilt slightly away from the building. This is so they will not fall on the tomb in the event of an earthquake. A huge dome was constructed over the center of the building. Precious stones were placed into the walls. They make the tomb sparkle at different times of the day. A special style of writing called calligraphy decorates the walls of the tomb. A long water pool was built outside the building and lined with trees and flowers. At certain times of the day, the beautiful Taj Mahal is reflected in the pool. The colors of the tomb change. They are pinkish in the morning, white in the evening and golden colors when the moon shines. Today, the bodies of shah Jahan and his wife lie beside one another in this monument to love.

Shah Jahan mempekerjakan 20.000 orang untuk membangun makam seperti istana.  Bangunan ini terbuat dari marmer putih dan berdiri di atas dasar batu pasir merah.  Ada tinggi di setiap sudut bangunan.  Menara miring sedikit menjauh dari bangunan.  Ini agar mereka tidak jatuh di atas makam jika terjadi gempa bumi.  Sebuah kubah besar dibangun di tengah bangunan.  Batu mulia ditempatkan di dinding.  Mereka membuat makam berkilau pada waktu yang berbeda dalam sehari.  Sebuah gaya tulisan khusus yang disebut kaligrafi menghiasi dinding makam.  Kolam air panjang dibangun di luar gedung dan dipagari dengan pepohonan dan bunga.  Pada waktu-waktu tertentu, Taj Mahal yang indah tercermin di kolam renang.  Warna makam berubah.  Mereka berwarna merah muda di pagi hari, putih di malam hari dan warna keemasan saat bulan bersinar.

                        The text provides information about rocks, including their physical characteristics, types, and uses.Diamond is valuable because it is very rare, and it has unique physical properties, such as its hardness, brilliance, and ability to refract light.Sandstone is a type of rock that is made up of sand-sized grains of mineral, rock, or organic material that are held together by a cementing material, such as silica, calcium carbonate, or iron oxide. It is formed through the process of lithification, which involves the compaction and cementation of loose sediment. Sandstone is a common rock type that is used in construction, for building facades, and for decorative purposes.<p></p><p>mohon maaf jika penjelasan yang saya berikan kurang</p><br />

It is located in Agra. Agra is a city in north central India.Work on the tomb began in 1632. It took more than twenty year to build. Shah Jahan hired20,000 men to construct the palace-like tomb. The building is made of white marble and sits on a baseof red sandstone. There are tall towers, called minarets, standing 133 feet tall at each corner of thebuilding. The minarets tilt slightly away from the building. This is so they will not fall on the tomb inthe event of an earthquake. A huge dome was constructed over the center of the building. Preciousstones were placed into the walls. They make the tomb sparkle at different times of the day. A specialstyle of writing called calligraphy decorates the walls of the tomb. A long water pool was built outsidethe building and lined with trees and flowers. At certain times of the day, the beautiful Taj Mahal isreflected in the pool. The colors of the tomb change. They are pinkish in the morning, white in theevening, and golden colors when the moon shines.Today, the bodies of Shah Jahan and his wife lie beside one another in this monument to love.Some call the Taj Mahal the eighth wonder of the world.​</h2><br />

The most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, is the main gate, which stands majestically in the centre of the southern wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the north front by double arcade galleries. The garden in front of the galleries is subdivided into four quarters by two main walkways and each quarters in turn subdivided by the narrower cross-axial walkways, on the Timurid-Persian scheme of thewalled in garden. The enclosure walls on the east and west have a pavilion 
at the centre.
The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones. The mosque and the guest house in the Taj Mahal complex are built of red sandstone in contrast to the marble tomb in the centre. Both the buildings have a large platform over the terrace at their front. Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical structures. They have an oblong massive prayer hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a row with central dominant portal. The frame of the portal arches and the spandrels are veneered in white marble. The spandrels are filled with flowery arabesques of stone intarsia and the arches bordered with rope molding.
The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast 
Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District 
in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory 
of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and 
completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main 
gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added 
subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several 
historical and Qur’anic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting 
the chronology of Taj Mahal.</h2><br />

                            37. The plain of jars in north east laos, is one of the oldest archeological mysteries in southeast asia.
Located on the plateau of xieng khouang, in the mountains of indochina, there are about 90 different jars sites. Eacha site contains from 1 to 400 jars. It has been estimated that they were created 3,000 years ago, and are made of sandstone, limestone, granite, breccias and conglomerate, with the majority being made of sandstone. The tallest jar              is about 9 feet tall and all        are made from their own individual slab of stone.
At first glance the jars appear to be haphazardly placed, with some standing upright and others on their sides, pointing in different directions. Further studies have revealed that they are placed in positions that form the constellation patterns of the stars. There has been lots of specukation about the purpose of the jars -drinking glasses for a giant race, being used to collect rainwater, or as burial urns.
Mors of the jars are empty, but a few have been found with bodies or tools inside, or filled with miniature Buddha statues. Exploration is hard as the area is littered with unixploded  bombs from the secret war.
