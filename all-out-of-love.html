LYRICS "Un-break My Heart"
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights 
When I held you beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart
Take back that sad word good-bye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry this tears
I cried so many, many nights
Un-break my heart
Un-break my heart oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart
Sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on
Can't go on.... </a>

This world is yours  At times I know it's going to be hard When you think you can't go on But there's a plan for you just let your heart follow through Come on, I promise you can do it all Cause when you fall you can always start again Your future's right in front of where you stand  Climb a mountain Cross the ocean Sail the river until it opens Make good friends, listen hard Let it out, and dance on.</a>

I used to think that you were down
But when times got rough i saw the truth
I thought i found a design of love that could be real life
But our hearts drifted apart
They no longer bind
Nothing’s alright you’re out of my mind
Chorus:
I remember when you wouldn’t come around
Now you want to be down
Not supposed to let you back in no way
I remember that day so well (so well, so well)
When you wouldn’t talk to me
Now you see me everyday on tv
You tried to play me and got played in return
Messed up on a real man, now your bridges are burned
Gave me time to figure out your scheme it’s all a dream now
Trying to get back in and you don’t know how
Now your all out of order and denial
Chorus (repeats twice)
Gave me time to figure out your scheme it’s all a dream now
You’re trying to get back in and you don’t know how
There’s no way no how

Now... cry out!
I'm watching closely... this world full of lies.
I'm picturing... the darkness known as love.
Even if I end up losing my heart,
I'll at least protect you until the end!
Tomorrow, this cruel hatred
Will reach out its hand,
Trying to keep us under its rule...
A storm of grief we must overcome...
A true nature we don't want to accept...
That's all too painful, too scary — please don't pay it mind!
(Please take the magic)
If these scars will never seal up, then even through the pain
I'll steal away your tears!
(I want to be strong for you)
Destroy every one of those pre-determined limitations,
Right now!
I'm looking up... at those dreams that didn't come true.
I'm seeking... something as unreliable as these bonds.
Even if I have to sacrifice this life,
I'll attain happiness, no matter what!
Eventually, this merciless sorrow
Will proceed to cover up
The future we're heading for...
An insurmountable vortex of anger
And a cherished desire that can never be embraced...
I hate it, it's too unfair — please don't show me!
(Please take the magic)
I don't care if I become a monster in the end,
'Cause then I could devour your despair!
(I don't want to hurt you)
Release the impulse being raised inside of you
And... cry out!
If a day without regrets will someday come,
Rather than simply praying, let's raise our voices — right now!
Cry out... this grief!
Cry out... this pain!
Cry out... this anger!
Cry out... "I'm right here!"
Let's embrace and keep on living, even if it's all a lie.
I'll believe... and choose you as my dream!
A storm of grief we must overcome...
A true ambition we hope to someday have forgiven...
That's all too painful, too scary — please don't pay it mind!
(I don't need magic)
If these scars will never seal up, then even through the pain
I'll steal away your tears!
(I want to be strong for you)
Destroy every one of those pre-determined limitations,
Right now!</a>

For all those times you stood by me
For all the truth that you made me see
For all the joy you brought to my life
For all the wrong that you made right
For every dream you made come true
For all the love I found in you
I’ll be forever thankful, baby
You’re the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You’re the one who saw me through
Through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn’t speak
You were my eyes when I couldn’t see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn’t reach
You gave me faith ’cause you believed
I’m everything I am
Because you loved me, ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I’m grateful for each day you gave me</a>

                                            the story tells us about?Once upon a time, in an island there lived all the feelings and emotions : Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day it was announced to them that the island would sink! So all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.  Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.  When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.  Richness was passing by Love in a boat. Love said,  "Richness, can you take me with you?" Richness answered, "Sorry Love, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat and so there is no place here for you."  Love next asked Vanity who was also sailing by. Vanity was also ready with the same answer.   "I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, take me along with you." "Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!", sadness said in a sullen voice.  Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so preoccupied with her happiness that she did not even hear when Love called her.   Suddenly, there was a voice, "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. An overjoyed Love jumped up into the boat and in the process forgot to ask where they were going. When they arrived at a dry land, the elder went her own way.   Realizing how much was owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge another elder, "Who Helped me?" "It was Time," Knowledge answered. "Time?" thought Love. Then, as if reading the face of Love, Knowledge smiled and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is." </a>

She's the part in the movie where it all adds up
So caught up in her eyes, so
Can't look away
I'm hypnotized
She's the hope in war when things look rough
Won't give up this fight
She'll be mine tonight
Oh oh
I will never hurt you, no
I will never desert you
See, there's a lot of girls in this world though they have nothing on you
I will be there… I'll be there…
When the words just come out wrong,
And you're sick of the love songs
I will be there… I'll be there…
When your strength is now all gone,
And you need someone to lean on
Even when you stop loving yourself,
I'll be there to help, oh yeah
And when you're giving up,
Just know you're always loved
You're always loved
She's the color in my cheeks when I talk too much
And I blush all the time
Oh, she's embarrassment that I love to find
“
I will be there… I'll be there…
— Golden
I will never hurt you, no
I will never desert you
There's a lot of girls in this world though they have nothing on you
I will be there… I'll be there…
When the words just come out wrong,
And you're sick of the love songs
I will be there… I'll be there…
When your strength is now all gone,
And you need someone to lean on
Even when you stop loving yourself,
I'll be there to help, oh yeah
And when you're giving up,
Just know you're always loved
You're always loved
You're always loved
Loved by me
Said I will be there, I'll be there
When the words just come out wrong,
And you're sick of this love song
I will be there… I'll be there...
When your strength is now all gone,
And you need someone to lean on
Even when you stop loving yourself,
I'll be there to help
And when you're giving up,
Just know you're always loved</a>

                                            I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone
Man, F that sh--
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick

                                            Dear All,At last, we are at the end of our academic year. I know the last few months haven’t been easy at all. We have been forced to do lots of activities so much different from what we did previously.Remember the time when the situation made us stay in instead of going out. We have experienced about “social distancing” as a strategy to fight COVID-19 as well as to protect ourselves. Also, we have been cancelling meeting appointments, hanging out activities, and even planned trips. I believe things have been tough for all of us.Now, you are facing final exams, you have been studying independently, you have been convincing yourselves that you could study from home, manage your time, try to understand lessons and do your assignments physically away from fellow students and teachers . So far, you survive. You are incredible!My wish for you is that you see the light in this world, in yourself, and in others. I see the light in you. Compliment others, and be proud of your own accomplishments. I am proud of you. Believe in yourself, for you are stronger than you know. I believe in you. Try hard, but know your limits. Ask if you need help, and trust others will help you. I will help you. Fill your heart with laughter and smile often. I love to see your smile. You are a unique, special, and amazing person. There will never be another you. I appreciate all of you.Dream, believe, wonder, inspire, love, nurture, and always listen. That is what I will do for you.Love,Your Biggest Supporter​</a>

[Verse 1:]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
[Pre-Chorus:]
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
[Chorus:]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh
[Verse 2:]
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
[Bridge:]
Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard</a>

Drawing me in, and you kicking me out

You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Kau membuat kepalaku berputar, tanpa candaan, ku takbisa mengecewakanmu
What's going on in that beautiful mind
Apa yang terjadi pada pemikiran indahitu
I'm on your magical mystery ride
Aku dalam perjalanan misteri ajaibmu
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Dan aku sangat pusing, tak tahu apa yang menimpaku, namun aku kan baik saja
My head's under water
Kepalaku didalam air
But I'm breathing fine
Namunaku bisa bernafas
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
Kau gila dan aku kehilangan akal
'Cause all of me
Karena semua diriku
Loves all of you
Mencintai semua yang ada pada dirimu
Love your curves and all your edges
Mencintai lekuk tubuhmu dan semua sisimu
All your perfect imperfections
Semua ketidaksempurnaan sempurnamu
Give your all to me
Berikan semuanya padaku
I'll give my all to you
Kan keberikan semua milikku padamu
You're my end and my beginning
Kau awal dan akhirku
Even when I lose I'm winning
Bahkan saat aku kalah, akumenang
'Cause I give you all of me
Karena kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semuanya padaku
How many times do I have to tell you
Berapa kali kuharus mengatakan padamu
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
Bahkan saat kau menangis kau tetap cantik
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
Dunia mengecewakanmu, aku melewati semua suasana hati
You're my downfall, you're my muse
Kau air terjunku, kau inspirasiku
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
Gangguan terburukku, iramaku, dan blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
Ku tak bisa berhenti bernyanyi, nadanya, di kepalaku untukmu
Give me all of you
Berikan semua padaku
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Karu di meja, kita berdua menunjukkan hati (AS)
Risking it all, though it's hard
Mempertaruhkan semua, meskipun sulit
I give you all of me

LYRICS "Un-break My Heart"
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights 
When I held you beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart
Take back that sad word good-bye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry these tears
I cried so many nights
Un-break my heart
My heart
Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me
Un-break my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked out of my life
Un-cry this tears
I cried so many, many nights
Un-break my heart
Un-break my heart oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Un-break my heart
Sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on
Can't go on.... </h2><br />

I know this world seems so big And everything seems so out of reach The sky is high and the walk is wide You've just don't know what you've got yet  It's in the palm of your hands It's right in front of where you stand  If you believe, everything you dream, will come true If you can love no matter how you hurt, Love will come to you, back to you. This world is yours  At times I know it's going to be hard When you think you can't go on But there's a plan for you just let your heart follow through Come on, I promise you can do it all Cause when you fall you can always start again Your future's right in front of where you stand  Climb a mountain Cross the ocean Sail the river until it opens Make good friends, listen hard Let it out, and dance on.</h2><br />

I used to think that you were down
But when times got rough i saw the truth
I thought i found a design of love that could be real life
But our hearts drifted apart
They no longer bind
Nothing’s alright you’re out of my mind
Chorus:
I remember when you wouldn’t come around
Now you want to be down
Not supposed to let you back in no way
I remember that day so well (so well, so well)
When you wouldn’t talk to me
Now you see me everyday on tv
You tried to play me and got played in return
Messed up on a real man, now your bridges are burned
Gave me time to figure out your scheme it’s all a dream now
Trying to get back in and you don’t know how
Now your all out of order and denial
Chorus (repeats twice)
Gave me time to figure out your scheme it’s all a dream now
You’re trying to get back in and you don’t know how
There’s no way no how

Now... cry out!
I'm watching closely... this world full of lies.
I'm picturing... the darkness known as love.
Even if I end up losing my heart,
I'll at least protect you until the end!
Tomorrow, this cruel hatred
Will reach out its hand,
Trying to keep us under its rule...
A storm of grief we must overcome...
A true nature we don't want to accept...
That's all too painful, too scary — please don't pay it mind!
(Please take the magic)
If these scars will never seal up, then even through the pain
I'll steal away your tears!
(I want to be strong for you)
Destroy every one of those pre-determined limitations,
Right now!
I'm looking up... at those dreams that didn't come true.
I'm seeking... something as unreliable as these bonds.
Even if I have to sacrifice this life,
I'll attain happiness, no matter what!
Eventually, this merciless sorrow
Will proceed to cover up
The future we're heading for...
An insurmountable vortex of anger
And a cherished desire that can never be embraced...
I hate it, it's too unfair — please don't show me!
(Please take the magic)
I don't care if I become a monster in the end,
'Cause then I could devour your despair!
(I don't want to hurt you)
Release the impulse being raised inside of you
And... cry out!
If a day without regrets will someday come,
Rather than simply praying, let's raise our voices — right now!
Cry out... this grief!
Cry out... this pain!
Cry out... this anger!
Cry out... "I'm right here!"
Let's embrace and keep on living, even if it's all a lie.
I'll believe... and choose you as my dream!
A storm of grief we must overcome...
A true ambition we hope to someday have forgiven...
That's all too painful, too scary — please don't pay it mind!
(I don't need magic)
If these scars will never seal up, then even through the pain
I'll steal away your tears!
(I want to be strong for you)
Destroy every one of those pre-determined limitations,
Right now!</h2><br />

I’ll be forever thankful, baby
You’re the one who held me up
Never let me fall
You’re the one who saw me through
Through it all
You were my strength when I was weak
You were my voice when I couldn’t speak
You were my eyes when I couldn’t see
You saw the best there was in me
Lifted me up when I couldn’t reach
You gave me faith ’cause you believed
I’m everything I am
Because you loved me, ooh, baby
You gave me wings and made me fly
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me
You said no star was out of reach
You stood by me and I stood tall
I had your love, I had it all
I’m grateful for each day you gave me</h2><br />

                            19. the story tells us about?Once upon a time, in an island there lived all the feelings and emotions : Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day it was announced to them that the island would sink! So all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.  Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.  When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.  Richness was passing by Love in a boat. Love said,  "Richness, can you take me with you?" Richness answered, "Sorry Love, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat and so there is no place here for you."  Love next asked Vanity who was also sailing by. Vanity was also ready with the same answer.   "I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, take me along with you." "Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!", sadness said in a sullen voice.  Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so preoccupied with her happiness that she did not even hear when Love called her.   Suddenly, there was a voice, "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. An overjoyed Love jumped up into the boat and in the process forgot to ask where they were going. When they arrived at a dry land, the elder went her own way.   Realizing how much was owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge another elder, "Who Helped me?" "It was Time," Knowledge answered. "Time?" thought Love. Then, as if reading the face of Love, Knowledge smiled and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is." </h2><br />

She's the part in the movie where it all adds up
So caught up in her eyes, so
Can't look away
I'm hypnotized
She's the hope in war when things look rough
Won't give up this fight
She'll be mine tonight
Oh oh
I will never hurt you, no
I will never desert you
See, there's a lot of girls in this world though they have nothing on you
I will be there… I'll be there…
When the words just come out wrong,
And you're sick of the love songs
I will be there… I'll be there…
When your strength is now all gone,
And you need someone to lean on
Even when you stop loving yourself,
I'll be there to help, oh yeah
And when you're giving up,
Just know you're always loved
You're always loved
She's the color in my cheeks when I talk too much
And I blush all the time
Oh, she's embarrassment that I love to find
“
I will be there… I'll be there…
— Golden
I will never hurt you, no
I will never desert you
There's a lot of girls in this world though they have nothing on you
I will be there… I'll be there…
When the words just come out wrong,
And you're sick of the love songs
I will be there… I'll be there…
When your strength is now all gone,
And you need someone to lean on
Even when you stop loving yourself,
I'll be there to help, oh yeah
And when you're giving up,
Just know you're always loved
You're always loved
You're always loved
Loved by me
Said I will be there, I'll be there
When the words just come out wrong,
And you're sick of this love song
I will be there… I'll be there...
When your strength is now all gone,
And you need someone to lean on
Even when you stop loving yourself,
I'll be there to help

                            24. I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Oh, you turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I've said it before
But all of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone
Man, F that sh--
I'll be out spending all this money
While you're sitting round wondering
Why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom
Now when you see me I'm stunting
And all of my cars start with a push of a button
Telling me the chances I blew up
Or whatever you call it
Switch the number to my phone
So you never could call it
Don't need my name on my show
You can tell it I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame could have got picked
Had a really good game but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could have saw but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up valet open doors
Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want, so you can go and take
That little piece of shit with you
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone, baby it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two
If Happy Ever Afters did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairy tales are full of it
One more stupid love song, I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone</h2><br />

                            29. Dear All,At last, we are at the end of our academic year. I know the last few months haven’t been easy at all. We have been forced to do lots of activities so much different from what we did previously.Remember the time when the situation made us stay in instead of going out. We have experienced about “social distancing” as a strategy to fight COVID-19 as well as to protect ourselves. Also, we have been cancelling meeting appointments, hanging out activities, and even planned trips. I believe things have been tough for all of us.Now, you are facing final exams, you have been studying independently, you have been convincing yourselves that you could study from home, manage your time, try to understand lessons and do your assignments physically away from fellow students and teachers . So far, you survive. You are incredible!My wish for you is that you see the light in this world, in yourself, and in others. I see the light in you. Compliment others, and be proud of your own accomplishments. I am proud of you. Believe in yourself, for you are stronger than you know. I believe in you. Try hard, but know your limits. Ask if you need help, and trust others will help you. I will help you. Fill your heart with laughter and smile often. I love to see your smile. You are a unique, special, and amazing person. There will never be another you. I appreciate all of you.Dream, believe, wonder, inspire, love, nurture, and always listen. That is what I will do for you.Love,Your Biggest Supporter​</h2><br />

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh
[Verse 2:]
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
[Bridge:]
Give me all of you

All Of Me
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Apa yang harus kulakukan tanpa mulut bawel?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Mengaturku, kau mencampakanku
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Kau membuat kepalaku berputar, tanpa candaan, ku takbisa mengecewakanmu
What's going on in that beautiful mind
Apa yang terjadi pada pemikiran indahitu
I'm on your magical mystery ride
Aku dalam perjalanan misteri ajaibmu
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Dan aku sangat pusing, tak tahu apa yang menimpaku, namun aku kan baik saja
My head's under water
Kepalaku didalam air
But I'm breathing fine
Namunaku bisa bernafas
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
Kau gila dan aku kehilangan akal
'Cause all of me
Karena semua diriku
Loves all of you
Mencintai semua yang ada pada dirimu
Love your curves and all your edges
Mencintai lekuk tubuhmu dan semua sisimu
All your perfect imperfections
Semua ketidaksempurnaan sempurnamu
Give your all to me
Berikan semuanya padaku
I'll give my all to you
Kan keberikan semua milikku padamu
You're my end and my beginning
Kau awal dan akhirku
Even when I lose I'm winning
Bahkan saat aku kalah, akumenang
'Cause I give you all of me
Karena kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semuanya padaku
How many times do I have to tell you
Berapa kali kuharus mengatakan padamu
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
Bahkan saat kau menangis kau tetap cantik
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
Dunia mengecewakanmu, aku melewati semua suasana hati
You're my downfall, you're my muse
Kau air terjunku, kau inspirasiku
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
Gangguan terburukku, iramaku, dan blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
Ku tak bisa berhenti bernyanyi, nadanya, di kepalaku untukmu
Give me all of you
Berikan semua padaku
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Karu di meja, kita berdua menunjukkan hati (AS)
Risking it all, though it's hard
Mempertaruhkan semua, meskipun sulit
I give you all of me
Kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semua padaku, ohoh

                            38. Read the following story and then decide whether the statements True or False. Correct the False statements.I’m sending out some cards.            A guy walks into a post office one day to see a middle-aged, balding man standing at the counter methodically placing “Love” stamps on bright pink envelopes with hearts all over them. He then takes out a perfume bottle and starts spraying scent all over them.            His curiosity getting the better of him, he goes up to the balding man and asks him what he is doing. The man says, “I’m sending out one thousand Valentine cards signed, ‘Guess who?’            “But why?” asks the man.            “I’m a divorce lawyer,” the man replies.StatementsTFCorrections1.      The main character of the story was a postman.2.      He was sending a ‘love mail’ to his wife.3.      He used perfume to spray the envelopes.4.      He sent hundreds of envelopes.5.

                            40. 1. Read the following lyric and then answer the questions!
All Of Me
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Apa yang harus kulakukan tanpa mulut bawel?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Mengaturku, kau mencampakanku
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
Kau membuat kepalaku berputar, tanpa candaan, ku takbisa mengecewakanmu
What's going on in that beautiful mind
Apa yang terjadi pada pemikiran indahitu
I'm on your magical mystery ride
Aku dalam perjalanan misteri ajaibmu
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
Dan aku sangat pusing, tak tahu apa yang menimpaku, namun aku kan baik saja
My head's under water
Kepalaku didalam air
But I'm breathing fine
Namunaku bisa bernafas
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
Kau gila dan aku kehilangan akal
'Cause all of me
Karena semua diriku
Loves all of you
Mencintai semua yang ada pada dirimu
Love your curves and all your edges
Mencintai lekuk tubuhmu dan semua sisimu
All your perfect imperfections
Semua ketidaksempurnaan sempurnamu
Give your all to me
Berikan semuanya padaku
I'll give my all to you
Kan keberikan semua milikku padamu
You're my end and my beginning
Kau awal dan akhirku
Even when I lose I'm winning
Bahkan saat aku kalah, akumenang
'Cause I give you all of me
Karena kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semuanya padaku
How many times do I have to tell you
Berapa kali kuharus mengatakan padamu
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
Bahkan saat kau menangis kau tetap cantik
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
Dunia mengecewakanmu, aku melewati semua suasana hati
You're my downfall, you're my muse
Kau air terjunku, kau inspirasiku
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
Gangguan terburukku, iramaku, dan blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
Ku tak bisa berhenti bernyanyi, nadanya, di kepalaku untukmu
Give me all of you
Berikan semua padaku
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Karu di meja, kita berdua menunjukkan hati (AS)
Risking it all, though it's hard
Mempertaruhkan semua, meskipun sulit
I give you all of me
Kuberikan semua padamu
And you give me all of you, ohoh
Dan kau berikan semua padaku, ohoh
