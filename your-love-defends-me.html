Bothhorned, although the female horns are smaller and shorter.Giraffes have spots covering their entire body, except for the lower part of the stomach. They have long necks. The neck of the male will continue to increase for more than twenty years of his life. They use their necks to trace the leaves of the trees. In addition, males use long necks for fights and competitions. Each giraffe can eat 63 kilograms of leaves and twigs every day.The giraffe defends itself from the threat by kicking with all its might) The adult giraffe's kick with one place can crush a lion's skull or break its backbone.RememberThe text above is included in descriptive text.Its generic structure consists of an Identification that identifies the phenomenon and a Description that describes its parts, qualities, and characteristics of the phenomenon.

                                            jawablah pertanyaan dari teks a lot of homework 	The amount of homework given to students needs to be reduced for several reasons. In short, time is limited in many students’ lives. At the same time, other students are showing alarming levels of obesity due to sedentary lifestyles. Lastly, family disharmony has increased as a result of stressed parents trying to get their children to do their homework.	Firstly, time is limited. Many students don’t arrive home until 6 pm. This is because they have chosen to play sports which require a few hours training each week or they engage in cultural activities, which are often taught after school. By the time they have finished dinner, showered and finished jobs it is 8pm. If they have homework, then it is too late to start. Therefore it is fair to say there is not enough time after school to complete quality homework.	On the other hand, many other young people are recording high levels of obesity because of their sedentary lifestyles. Why sit still at night when students have been sitting still in classrooms all day? This is not good for their health and contributes to the high level of obesity seen today.	Finally, homework places huge amounts of stress on already stressed out families. In many families both parents are working and the last thing they need is to fight with their children at the end of a stressful day.	In conclusion, homework should be reduced. We must recognize that students’ time is limited, sedentary work contributes to the high levels of obesity and finally, homework can cause an increase in family disharmony. The wellbeing of students is far more important than excessive amounts of homework.5.

                                            jawablah pertanyaan dari teks a lot of homework 	The amount of homework given to students needs to be reduced for several reasons. In short, time is limited in many students’ lives. At the same time, other students are showing alarming levels of obesity due to sedentary lifestyles. Lastly, family disharmony has increased as a result of stressed parents trying to get their children to do their homework.	Firstly, time is limited. Many students don’t arrive home until 6 pm. This is because they have chosen to play sports which require a few hours training each week or they engage in cultural activities, which are often taught after school. By the time they have finished dinner, showered and finished jobs it is 8pm. If they have homework, then it is too late to start. Therefore it is fair to say there is not enough time after school to complete quality homework.	On the other hand, many other young people are recording high levels of obesity because of their sedentary lifestyles. Why sit still at night when students have been sitting still in classrooms all day? This is not good for their health and contributes to the high level of obesity seen today.	Finally, homework places huge amounts of stress on already stressed out families. In many families both parents are working and the last thing they need is to fight with their children at the end of a stressful day.	In conclusion, homework should be reduced. We must recognize that students’ time is limited, sedentary work contributes to the high levels of obesity and finally, homework can cause an increase in family disharmony. The wellbeing of students is far more important than excessive amounts of homework.5.

                            15. jawablah pertanyaan dari teks a lot of homework 	The amount of homework given to students needs to be reduced for several reasons. In short, time is limited in many students’ lives. At the same time, other students are showing alarming levels of obesity due to sedentary lifestyles. Lastly, family disharmony has increased as a result of stressed parents trying to get their children to do their homework.	Firstly, time is limited. Many students don’t arrive home until 6 pm. This is because they have chosen to play sports which require a few hours training each week or they engage in cultural activities, which are often taught after school. By the time they have finished dinner, showered and finished jobs it is 8pm. If they have homework, then it is too late to start. Therefore it is fair to say there is not enough time after school to complete quality homework.	On the other hand, many other young people are recording high levels of obesity because of their sedentary lifestyles. Why sit still at night when students have been sitting still in classrooms all day? This is not good for their health and contributes to the high level of obesity seen today.	Finally, homework places huge amounts of stress on already stressed out families. In many families both parents are working and the last thing they need is to fight with their children at the end of a stressful day.	In conclusion, homework should be reduced. We must recognize that students’ time is limited, sedentary work contributes to the high levels of obesity and finally, homework can cause an increase in family disharmony. The wellbeing of students is far more important than excessive amounts of homework.5.

                            29. jawablah pertanyaan dari teks a lot of homework 	The amount of homework given to students needs to be reduced for several reasons. In short, time is limited in many students’ lives. At the same time, other students are showing alarming levels of obesity due to sedentary lifestyles. Lastly, family disharmony has increased as a result of stressed parents trying to get their children to do their homework.	Firstly, time is limited. Many students don’t arrive home until 6 pm. This is because they have chosen to play sports which require a few hours training each week or they engage in cultural activities, which are often taught after school. By the time they have finished dinner, showered and finished jobs it is 8pm. If they have homework, then it is too late to start. Therefore it is fair to say there is not enough time after school to complete quality homework.	On the other hand, many other young people are recording high levels of obesity because of their sedentary lifestyles. Why sit still at night when students have been sitting still in classrooms all day? This is not good for their health and contributes to the high level of obesity seen today.	Finally, homework places huge amounts of stress on already stressed out families. In many families both parents are working and the last thing they need is to fight with their children at the end of a stressful day.	In conclusion, homework should be reduced. We must recognize that students’ time is limited, sedentary work contributes to the high levels of obesity and finally, homework can cause an increase in family disharmony. The wellbeing of students is far more important than excessive amounts of homework.5.
